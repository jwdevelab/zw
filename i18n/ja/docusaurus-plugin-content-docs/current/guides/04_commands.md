## Updating ZI and plugins {#updating-zi-and-plugins}

To update ZI issue `zi self-update` in the command line.

To update all plugins and snippets, issue `zi update`.

<div align="center"><img src="/img/include/update.png" alt="Update" /></div>

If you wish to update only a single plugin/snippet instead issue `zi update NAME_OF_PLUGIN`. A list of commits will be shown if any.

Some plugins require performing an action each time they're updated. One way you can do this is by using the `atpull` ice modifier. For example, writing `zi ice atpull'./configure'` before loading a plugin will execute `./configure` after a successful update. Refer to [Ice Modifiers](/search/?q=ice-modifiers) for more information.

The ice modifiers for any plugin or snippet are stored in their directory in a `._zi` subdirectory, hence the plugin doesn't have to be loaded to be correctly updated. There's one other file created there, `.zi_lstupd` ‚Äì it holds the log of the new commits pulled-in in the last update.

## Calling `compinit` without turbo mode {#calling-compinit-without-turbo-mode}

With no Turbo mode in use, compinit can be called normally, i.e.: as `autoload compinit; compinit`. This should be done after loading of all plugins and before possibly calling `zi cdreplay`.

The `cdreplay` subcommand is provided to re-play all caught `compdef` calls. The `compdef` calls are used to define a completion for a command. For example, `compdef _git git` defines that the `git` command should be completed by a `_git` function.

The `compdef` function is provided by `compinit` call. As it should be called later, after loading all of the plugins, ZI provides its own `compdef` function that catches (i.e.: records in an array) the arguments of the call, so that the loaded plugins can freely call `compdef`. Then, the `cdreplay` (compdef-replay) can be used, after `compinit` will be called (and the original `compdef` function will become available), to execute all detected `compdef` calls. To summarize:

```shell title=~/.zshrc
source ~/.zi/bin/zi.zsh

zi load "some/plugin"

(‚Ä¶)

compdef _gnu_generic fd  # this will be intercepted by ZI, because as the compinit
                         # isn't yet loaded, thus there's no such function `compdef'; yet
                         # ZI provides its own `compdef' function which saves the
                         # completion-definition for later possible re-run with `zi
                         # cdreplay' or `zicdreplay' (the second one can be used in hooks
                         # like atload'‚Ä¶', atinit'‚Ä¶', etc.)

(‚Ä¶)

zi load "other/plugin"

autoload -Uz compinit
compinit

zi cdreplay -q      # -q is for quiet; actually, run all the `compdef's saved before
                    #`compinit` call (`compinit' declares the `compdef' function, so
                    # it cannot be used until `compinit' is run; ZI solves this
                    # via intercepting the `compdef'-calls and storing them for later
                    # use with `zi cdreplay')
```

This allows calling compinit once.

:::tip

Performance gains are huge, for example, shell startup time with double `compinit`: **0.980** sec, with `cdreplay` and single `compinit`: **0.156** sec.

## Calling `compinit` with turbo mode {#calling-compinit-with-turbo-mode}

If you load completions using `wait'‚Ä¶'` [turbo mode](/search?q=turbo+mode) then you can add `atinit'zicompinit'` to the syntax-highlighting plugin (which should be the last one loaded, as their (2 projects, [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) & [F-Sy-H](https://github.com/z-shell/F-Sy-H)) documentation state), or `atload'zicompinit'` to last completion-related plugin. `zicompinit` is a function that just runs `autoload compinit; compinit`, created for convenience. There's also `zicdreplay` which will replay any caught compdefs so you can also do: `atinit'zicompinit; zicdreplay'`, etc. Basically, the whole topic is the same as normal `compinit` call, but it is done in `atinit` or `atload` hook of the last related plugin with the use of the helper functions (`zicompinit`,`zicdreplay` & `zicdclear` ‚Äì see below for explanation of the last one).

### Summary of `compinit` call: {#summary-of-compinit-call}

```shell {10} title=~/.zshrc
source ~/.zi/bin/zi.zsh

# Load using the for-syntax
zi wait lucid for \
    "some/plugin"

zi wait lucid for \
    "other/plugin"

zi wait lucid atload"zicompinit; zicdreplay" blockf for \
    zsh-users/zsh-completions
```

### Ignoring compdefs {#ignoring-compdefs}

If you want to ignore compdefs provided by some plugins or snippets, place their load commands before commands loading other plugins or snippets, and issue `zi cdclear` (or `zicdclear`, designed to be used in hooks like `atload'‚Ä¶'`):

```shell title=~/.zshrc
source ~/.zi/bin/zi.zsh
zi snippet OMZP::git
zi cdclear -q # <- forget completions provided by Git plugin

zi load "some/plugin"

(‚Ä¶)

zi load "other/plugin"

autoload -Uz compinit
compinit
zi cdreplay -q # <- execute compdefs provided by rest of plugins
zi cdlist # look at gathered compdefs
```

The `cdreplay` is important if you use plugins like `OMZP::kubectl` or `asdf-vm/asdf`, because these plugins call `compdef`.

Following commands are passed to `zi ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶` to obtain described effects.

## Loading and unloading {#loading-and-unloading}
